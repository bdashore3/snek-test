# Snektest

A working JS example for issues with dynamic client IDs in the discord-rpc library.

There are 3 cases that I have tested and outlined here in comments, please test them individually.

## How to test
1. Launch the electron app with `yarn start`
2. Enter a correct discord application ID in the box first and observe the RPC status on your profile.
3. Enter an incorrect application ID (random string of letters and numbers), let the program error, then enter the correct client ID and observe.
